*Hands-on training in R, Python, visualization, mapping, and reproducible data workflows.*

I provide training and workshops on various data science concepts and tools. These are customized to your specific needs, are interactive, and include "live" data work. 

Based on your needs and available time, I can design training and workshops of various durations: from half-day to multiple-day workshops, and even sessions spread out over multiple weeks.
